# BenchmarkLite

A lightweight Julia package for simple performance benchmark.

------------

This package is mainly for the purpose of comparing the performance of procedures (algorithms, implementations, etc). 

### Main Features

- Easy to use. (We will use a simple example to illustrate this below)
- Very lightweight. (No dependency on any other packages. It is about 200 lines of codes.)
- Pretty printing of results.
- Results can be export to CSV files.

### Examples

Here is [an example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lindahua/BenchmarkLite.jl/blob/master/examples/mathfuns_benchmark.ipynb) in the form as IJulia notebook.

This example illustrates the use of this package step-by-step.

*BenchmarkLite* is being used by some other packages (*e.g*, [StatsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl), and [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)) for benchmarking.
